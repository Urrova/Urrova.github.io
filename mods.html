				<p>You just infiltrated an enemy base to find out where so many demons came from, and you discover a portal. 
				You decided to enter the portal and it took you to a surprising place: 
				Another dimension, where demons are produced to fight allies with enemies. 
				Can you defeat the one who controls the dimension and then destroy the dimension?</p>

				<p>This wad is a non-terry version of SIGTAGNY.wad, which originally had terry traps, 
				screamers and shit. I grabbed it and made my own version of SIGTAGNY.wad, which is this pk3.</p>

				<p>A new demon base was installed on earth, and you must steal the invasion data to counter the attacks, however you realize the FURDEMON's true plan, quite strange: to turn all the inhabitants of the planet into a kind of "furries" to attack other planets. You must destroy FURDEMON as soon as possible! </p>

				<p>This is my first single player wad, I hope you enjoy it! </p>

<p>Recommendations: You should be able to jump and duck You should be able to freelook, since it's easier to fly You should play it with hardware renderer (OpenGL, Vulkan, etc), since it has dynamic lights, brightmaps, sprite rotations, etc.</p>
